# CS 142 Project 6: Large Integers
{: .no_toc }

**Reminder:** Everything in this project must be your own work.  If you include any code that was not invented by you, you must give a citation for 
it.

## Getting Started

1.  Download the starter code  [here](largeint-starter.zip). This zip file will unzip into a  `src`  folder.
2.  Make a new Intellij project. Then copy the contents of this  `src`  folder exactly into the  `src`  folder in the new project.

## Introduction
There are four different built-in (primitive) Java data types that can hold integers.  They are `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`, and take up 1, 
2, 4, and 8 bytes of storage, respectively.  Because each of these used a fixed number of bytes, there are only a certain number of possible 
integers each type can represent.  For instance, the smallest integer an `int` can represent is $$-2^{31}$$, or -2,147,483,648, whereas the largest is 
$$2^{31}-1$$, or 2,147,483,647.

When you exceed the limits of what an `int` can handle, Java will not realize it.  Consider the following code:
```java
int x = 2147483646;  
System.out.println(x);  
x++;  
System.out.println(x);  
x++;  
System.out.println(x);  
x++;  
System.out.println(x);
```
When this code runs, it prints the following:
```
2147483646
2147483647
-2147483648
-2147483647
```
What is happening is that when `x` becomes equal to 2147483647, adding 1 to the number causes an [overflow 
error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow), which, from the user's standpoint, causes the value of the variable to wrap around to the 
most negative number possible in the range.  This will happen with any of the four primitive integer data types.

You can imagine situations in which it would be useful to have an integer data type that *never* overflows (or at least not until we exceed the size 
of the computer's memory).  One way to accomplish this is to not represent an integer by a single variable, but by multiple variables.  Our strategy 
will be to use an `ArrayList` of integers to represent an integer with any number of digits: we store each digit of the integer in each position in 
the `ArrayList`.  We will built a class called `LargeInt` to accomplish this.

## The `LargeInt` class

Your LargeInt class will use an `ArrayList` of integers to represent a non-negative integer.  Though it sounds weird, you should store the digits in 
**backwards** order (it will make your later algorithms easier). For instance, the integer 6805 would be represented as an `ArrayList` of ints as in 
the diagram below.
```
position:    [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]
           -------------------------
value:     |  5  |  0  |  8  |  6  |
           -------------------------
```
### Why backwards?
Eventually, you will have to write an algorithm to add two LargeInts together. Your algorithm will simulate the elementary-school addition 
algorithm, which aligns integers to the right so the place-values match up between them:
```
  6805
 +  32
======
  6837
```
If you make your `ArrayLists` store the digits in "normal" order, you get the following:
```
position:    [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]
           -------------------------
value:     |  6  |  8  |  0  |  5  |
           -------------------------
           -------------
value:     |  3  |  2  |
           -------------
```
In this representation, the digits don't line up right. You can still write the addition algorithm, but the logic is trickier because the positions 
don't match up between the two vectors. However, if you store the digits in "backwards" order, everything lines up:
```
position:    [0]   [1]   [2]   [3]
           -------------------------
value:     |  5  |  0  |  8  |  6  |
           -------------------------
           -------------
value:     |  2  |  3  |
           -------------
```
This is a very good exercise in how the internal representation (what the class designer sees) of a class does not *necessarily* have to match its 
external representation (what the user of the class sees).

## A look at the code
- `LargeInt.java`: This is where you will write your LargeInt class.
- `LargeIntTester.java`: This is where you will write test cases for your LargeInt class.  You will notice the `main()` method is just a bunch of 
calls to other testing functions, all commented out.  You will write these functions later, and you can comment/uncomment the calls as you complete 
the project.
- `LargeIntDemo.java`: This is where you will write your final demonstration of the LargeInt class.
- `OverflowDemo.java`: This is a demonstration of integer overflow, which you can run if you want to see it happen.  There is nothing here you need 
to modify.

## Part A: Writing the LargeInt class
You will need to add a number of methods to the LargeInt class, as right now you will notice it only has a single instance variable for the digits 
of the number, and nothing else.

Here are the methods you will need to add.  You can write them in (almost) any order, though some make more sense before others.  For each method 
you **must** write a set of corresponding test cases in `LargeIntTester.java`.

### Constructors

You must write a default constructor.  The signature for this constructor should be
```
public LargeInt()
```
This constructor should initialize the LargeInt to represent the integer zero.  You can choose how to represent zero in the `digits` ArrayList; this 
might be with a completely empty ArrayList or an ArrayList with a single `0` in it.
<hr>

You must write a constructor that initializes a LargeInt from a `String`.  The signature for this constructor is
```
public LargeInt(String str)
```
This constructor may assume the `String` passed in contains a valid nonnegative integer, and the code should initialize the LargeInt to represent 
the same integer.
<hr>
You must write a constructor that initializes a LargeInt from an `int`.  The signature for this constructor is

```
public LargeInt(int i)
```
This constructor may assume the `int` passed in contains a nonnegative integer, and the code should initialize the LargeInt to represent the same 
integer.
<hr>

### `toString()`
You must write a `toString()` method.  The signature for this method should be

```
public String toString()
```
The `toString()` method should simply return a `String` with the "normal" representation of the integer.  Note that since you are storing the digits 
in "reversed" order, you will of course need to iterate through the array backwards.

- **Testing:**

  You must write a `testConstructors()` method in `LargeIntTester.java` that tests the three constructors and the `toString()` method.  You should 
write enough tests to convince yourself these constructors and methods work.  Do not delete the tests when you're done.  You can just comment out 
the call to `testConstructors()`.

### Calculating the number of digits
You must write a method to return the number of digits in an integer.    The signature for this method should be:
```
public int numDigits()
```
- **Testing**: You may write a new test method or integrate these tests with the constructors/toString().

### Testing two integers for equality
You must write a method to test if two integers are the same.  The method signature is 
```
public boolean equals(Object other)
```
This is a method inherited from the `Object` class in Java, which is why the parameter is specified to be `Object`.  Writing an `equals()` method is 
fairly straightforward.  You can follow the pattern here:
https://www.baeldung.com/java-comparing-objects#equals-instance

- **Testing:** Fill in the `testEquals()` method.  You may want to wait to really test this until you write the `add()` method, which will give you 
some more test cases.

### Adding two LargeInts
**Note: This method requires writing pseudocode first!**
You must write a method to add two integers together and return their sum as a new integer.  The method signature is
```
public LargeInt add(LargeInt other)
```
You should follow the "elementary school" algorithm for adding two integers together.  You will use a loop to iterate over the digits from 
right-most digit to left-most, adding pairs of digits as you go. If you get a sum less than ten, that becomes a digit in your answer. If you get a 
sum greater than or equal to ten, only the one's digit goes into your sum, and you will have to "carry" the one to the following column.

**Plan your pseudocode out on paper first (or in a text editor) and work through some examples.** You will turn this in as part of your final 
submission, so don't throw it out.

Special considerations:

-   What do you do if the two numbers have differing numbers of digits?
-   How do you handle the carry at the end of the loop if your answer will have more digits than either of the starting numbers?
-   Good examples to try: 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 99 + 1, 1 + 99, 1234 + 4321, 123456789 + 987654321.

- **Testing**: Fill in `testAdd()` and use a lot of examples to make sure this works! 

### Multiplying two LargeInts
Write a method to multiply two LargeInts and return the product.  The method signature is
```
public LargeInt multiply(LargeInt other)
```

You do not have to simulate the elementary-school multiplication algorithm here (though you can if you want). Instead, just make a for loop that 
does repeated addition. In other words, to multiply 9 by 5, make a new LargeInt, set it to zero, then add 9 to the new LargeInt five times. Yes this 
is slow, but it works.

**Be careful with implementing multiplication; this can really slow down your code if you do it wrong:**
 
Say I want to multiply 100 by 3. I can calculate this as 100 + 100 + 100, or 3 + 3 + 3 +...+ 3 (100 total additions). It is much faster to do the 
first calculation (3 additions) rather than the second calculation (100 additions). Make sure your multiplication function is doing the faster 
version.

- **Testing**: Fill in `testMultiply()` and use a lot of examples to make sure this works! 

### Comparing LargeInts
You will write a method to compare two LargeInts to see which one is bigger.  You will do this using a standard Java interface called `Comparable`.  
You can read the documentation for it here: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html

First, you should change the beginning of the LargeInt class to read:
```
public class LargeInt implements Comparable<LargeInt>
```
This tells Java we are implementing the `Comparable` interface, and our LargeInts should be comparable against other LargeInts.  (Usually the part 
inside the angle brackets with `Comparable` will match the name of the class that implements the interface, though it doesn't have to match.)

To implement `Comparable`, add a method to the class:
```
public int compareTo(LargeInt other)
```
This method should return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if this LargeInt is less than, equal to, or greater than the "`other`" 
LargeInt.  The specific values of the negative or positive integers don't matter; you can use -1, 0, and +1 if you want.

To implement this method, invent an algorithm for examining two integers to see which one is bigger, and return an appropriate integer.

- **Testing**: Test your code in the `testCompareTo()` method.  You can also use the `testSorting()` method that I wrote for you --- this method 
illustrates what you can do with classes that implement `Comparable`!

## Part B: Using the LargeInt class
Now, you will use the LargeInt class to solve a (semi-)real world problem: computing factorials for large numbers.  Recall that the factorial 
function is defined as:
```
fact(0) = 1
fact(n) = 1 * 2 * ... * n, for n > 0
```

This function grows very quickly, so quickly, in fact, that computing the factorial of any integer past about 25 quickly exceeds the capacity of a 
regular `long` integer in Java.  You will use the LargeInt class to compute the factorials of all integers between 0 and 100.

First, go to LargeIntDemo.java, and write a (static) function called `LargeInt factorial(LargeInt li)` that computes the factorial of the LargeInt 
parameter `li` and returns it.  Then, in `main()`, write a loop to print out the factorials of 0 through 100, **along with the number of digits in 
each factorial** (this last part is good for testing/debugging).

Hint: do not try to write this function recursively, because you will need a subtraction method for LargeInts and you don't have one!

## At the end of the project

-   As you are preparing to submit the project, please prepare a text file (`.txt`, pdf, or Word doc is fine) answering the following questions:
    1.  What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter? How did you overcome them? What did you learn?
    2.  Describe whatever help (if any) that you received. Don’t include readings, lectures, and exercises, but do include any help from other 
sources, such as websites or people (including classmates and friends) and attribute them by name.
    3.  Describe any serious problems you encountered while writing the program.
    4.  Did you do any of the challenges (see below)? If so, explain what you did.
    5.  List any other feedback you have. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you 
enjoyed doing it.
-   Please also add a comment at the top of your program stating your name and a pledge that you have followed the honor code and collaboration 
policy for this project. This can be as simple as writing “**I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this program.**” You can find the 
collaboration policy on the syllabus.
-   Remember, projects will be graded not only on correctness, but also appropriateness and efficiency of the algorithms you choose, and on coding 
style.

## Grading
This project will be graded on the correctness of the output, efficiency of the algorithms, and on coding style, including comments.

## Challenge Problems
From time to time, I will offer “challenge problems” on assignments. These problems are designed to have little (but some) impact on your grade 
whether you do them or not. You should think of these problems as opportunities to work on something interesting and optional, rather than a way to 
raise your grade through “extra credit.”

-   Add other math operators to the LargeInt class: subtraction, division, remainder (%), etc.
-   Make the multiplication algorithm work like the elementary school method, rather than repeated addition (which is slow).


## Submitting
To submit, upload all of your `.java` files to canvas, along with your answers to the post-project questions, and your pseudocode/pictures/notes for 
how you constructed your addition algorithm.  This doesn't have to be formal, and if you just have notes on a page, you can turn in photos.
